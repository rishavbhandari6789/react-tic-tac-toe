## 💡 Why I Built This Project

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of **React hooks**, **state management**, and **component-based architecture**.
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet powerful example of how logic and UI can work together seamlessly.

Through this project, I learned how to:

* Manage and update component state dynamically
* Handle user interactions and conditional rendering
* Implement clean, modular game logic (win/draw detection)
* Build responsive, interactive interfaces with **React + Vite**

This project also demonstrates my ability to create intuitive user experiences while keeping the codebase maintainable and scalable.
